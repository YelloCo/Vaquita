# Introduction
First off, thank you for considering contributing to Vaquita.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### Types of Contributions 
Vaquita is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code which can be incorporated into Vaquita itself.

# Ground Rules
Responsibilities
* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one or two new features per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Vaquita? You can start by looking through the Issues in this repository.
You can also install Vaquita yourself and look for bugs or features that might need to be worked on.

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

# Getting started
Basic steps for contributing to the project:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
   * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
   * Sign the Contributor License Agreement, CLA, with Yello.
   * Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file.

# How to report a bug
If you find a security vulnerability, please do NOT open an issue. Email security<at>yello.co instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

To file a bug report, simply create an Issue in this repository. The instructions for filing are included in the template when you create a new Issue. 

If you already have a fix for bug you've found, submit a Pull Request using the steps above and reference the PR number in the Issue.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Vaquita, please open an issue on our issues list and follow the template that is already populated into the form.

# Code review process
The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis. A member of the team should reply or give feedback to issues and pull requests at least once per week. 

If feedback from the pull request or issue creator isn't received within a couple of weeks, a member of the core team might close the pull request or issue if it isn't showing any activity.

# Code Style
This project is written in Ruby using Ruby on Rails. A tool called Rubocop enforces code styles in the repository. You can run the tool locally when you make a change by running `bundle exec rubocop`.

Code style tests are run when pull requests are submitted, so if your code breaks a code style convention, you will be alerted in the pull request.
